Hey There 😊. Welcome to my humble abode! In the realm of programming, I am an explorer 🌍, an architect 👷🏿‍♂️, and a creator 💹. Join me on a journey through my portfolio, where you'll witness the projects that define my love for development and research.

I recently completed my Masters of Science in Computer Science with AI specialization at [Arizona State University](). Working at [Lumen Technology]() (Software Engineer) and have previously worked with [Standard Chartered Bank]() (Software Developer), [Centre of Artificial Intelligence and Research Lab, DRDO]() (AI Research Intern), and [CustomerXps Solutions]() (Data Science Intern). 

Personally, I believe both the fields - Artificial Intelligence and Full Stack development are paramount to the growth of a programmer. Staying foolish and staying hungry defines my nature and for this reason I have always made sure to actively grab any opportunity that comes my way. This has allowed me to be proficient not only in `Full Stack Web and Mobile Development`, but also in `Deep Reinforcement Learning`.
